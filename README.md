Description:	
------------
The	task was	to	develop	a	basic	web	application	for	an	online	newspaper	
using	the	Django	framework.	The	site	should	provide	the	following	basic	functionalities:		
1. News articles should be categorised into sections; e.g. Sports, Business, etc ...
1. Users	have	the	option	of	creating	a	personal	account	and	are	able	to	login	and	logout.	
   The	user	should	log	in	using	their	email	address	(which	should	be	unique)	and	
   password.
1. The	user’s	account	should	contain	at	least	email,	password,	name	and	phone	number.
1. If	a	user	is	logged	in	they	are	able	to	:
   * update	their	name	and/or	phone	number		
   * post	comments	on	any	of	the	news	articles	
   * delete	a	comment	he	or	she	posted	previously	
   * like	or	dislike	any	of	the	news	articles	.

Outcome:	Once	fully	tested,	your	application	should	be	deployed	to	the	school’s	openshift	
web	servers	(to	be	discussed	in	week	10).	Each	group	should	submit	the	code	together	
with	a	one-page	report	describing	one	extra	feature	that	goes	beyond	the	minimal	
requirements	above.	Submit	these	as	a	single	zip	Vile.	Remember	to	include	in	the	report	
the	URL	of	your	deployed	application,	and	the	username	and	password	for	the	admin	
page.
